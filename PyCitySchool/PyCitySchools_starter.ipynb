    "\n",
    "# Based on various analysis performed on the school and student data, here are 3 high level insights\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.  Overall Charter schools performed better compared to public district schools in all metrics. It is more visible,when you look at overall math score.  More study need to be done to see what Charter schools are doing better especially in mathematics to see how it can be replicated in public district schools. Another dimension of analysis of this result is to see whether the effect is due to specific school practices or students who are enrolled at charter school are generally smarter or charter school tend to serve smaller student populations per school.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Overall, smaller and medium sized schools greatly out-performed large schools on passing math performance (93% vs. 67%).  This shows that student size of the class / school has direct \n",
    "# correlation to the student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Finally, schools with higher budgets, did not yield great test results. However, schools with higher spending per student (let say $645 - $675) vastly under performed compared to schools with  smaller spending per student (< $585 per student).While more analysis need to understand at more granular level of what is really going on, at ahigh level, it says that higher budget or higher spending per student does not have any direct correlation to performance."
